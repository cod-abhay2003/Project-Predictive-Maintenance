Objective:
To predict machine failures using a dataset of 10,000 data points, involving data extraction, manipulation (feature scaling, oversampling, etc.), and applying LSTM and Random Forest models. The performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, and precision.

Data Extraction and Manipulation:
The dataset containing 10,000 data points was loaded and inspected. Link for dtaset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/601/ai4i+2020+predictive+maintenance+dataset. Missing values were checked and handled. Numerical features were scaled to normalize the data. Class imbalance in the dataset was addressed using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

Modeling:
Two models were used: Random Forest and LSTM.

Random Forest:
A Random Forest classifier was built and hyperparameters were tuned using GridSearchCV. The model was evaluated using cross-validation and test data. Feature importances were extracted to understand the contribution of each feature.

LSTM:
Data was prepared for time series analysis required by LSTM. An LSTM network was built and trained using TensorFlow/Keras. The model was evaluated using relevant metrics.

Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: Proportion of correctly predicted instances over the total instances.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions over all positive predictions.
Recall: Proportion of true positive predictions over all actual positives.
ROC-AUC Score: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, evaluating the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
Results:
Both Random Forest and LSTM models were implemented and evaluated on multiple metrics. The results showed high accuracy for both models. F1 score, precision, and recall provided a detailed evaluation of model performance. Feature importances in Random Forest highlighted significant features, while LSTM offered insights into the time-series nature of the data.

Conclusion:
The project successfully implemented both LSTM and Random Forest models for predicting machine failures. The comparison of the models highlighted their strengths and weaknesses, aiding in the selection of the appropriate model for predictive maintenance tasks based on specific requirements and data characteristics.
